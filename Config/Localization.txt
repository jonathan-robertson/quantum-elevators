So long as they are properly aligned, standing on one and looking up/down will allow you to travel to the other.\n\nThis panel can be picked up, [ff8000]but it cannot be locked[-] and is not recommended for securing a base.\n\nIf you need the extra security and don't mind it permanently being bolted into place, craft a Secure Quantum Elevator."

quantumElevatorTip00,Journal Tip,,"These vertical warp panels will allow you to easily and fluidly expand your base deep into the ground and/or upward toward the sky.\n\nIf you place one of these panels [ff8000]directly above or below the other[-], simply [ff8000]stand on one and look in the direction of the other[-] to travel there! Your view angle will be reset and you can immediately look up or down again to travel to the next panel in the sequence.\n\nThere are two types of these panels available: Portable and Secure - you'll want to become familiar with each of them since they're best used in different situations (see additional journal entries).\n\nYou can [ff8000]craft either panel at the workbench[-] when you have the necessary items, or simply [ff8000]purchase them from any trader[-]."
quantumElevatorTip01,Journal Tip,,"These panels can be picked up after being placed, but [ff8000]they must be fully repaired to do so[-].\n\nIf you're trying to secure a base, it's highly recommended to use Secure Quantum Elevator Panels instead. Even though other players won't be able to take your panels when placed within range of your LCB, [ff007f]these panels have no locks or security features on them and would allow an attacking player to access other parts of your base you might want to keep secured[-].\n\nInstead, Portable Quantum Elevators often hold the advantage while constructing and planning a base, building simple structures you might not need later, coordinating with other players to move quickly within a large city building, or even setting an escape point partway through a quest to dump excess items off at your vehicle on the ground floor."
quantumElevatorTip02,Journal Tip,,"These Panels [ff8000]cannot be picked up once placed[-], but they can be [00ff80]locked[-]/[00ff80]unlocked[-] and [00ff80]receive a password[-]. You can also [00ff80]leave a secure note for yourself that only you and other authenticated players can view[-] (good for reminding your team which password you applied to this panel).\n\nThe password for each of the Secured Panels you want to travel to must either share the same owner and password as the panel you are traveling from, or you must be separately authenticated with that destination panel you're attempting to visit.\n\nIf you cannot be authenticated with the panel in the elevator sequence you're attempting to travel to, that panel will be skipped and the following panel in the sequence (if present) will be checked.\n\n[Hint] You can use this mechanic to include [00ff80]hidden rooms/floors[-] within your base's structure without it being overly clear that such a room exists. Simply set the panel in the 'hidden' room/floor to a different password from the rest."
